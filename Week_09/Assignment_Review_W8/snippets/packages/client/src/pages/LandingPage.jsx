                  The Kenzie fam is a tight knit group. However, you may not
                  have much exposure to students outside of your pod or program.
                  Snippets allows you to chat with people across the entire
                  Academy, some of which you may not have interacted with
                  otherwise. Take the leap and start connecting!
